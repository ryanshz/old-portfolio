            <h3><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a></h3>
            <p>The Microsoft site is my example of a good site, and is also the site I reference most when making design changes to my own site. The site features great use of the CRAP principles, where
                the contrast is done well, the use of repetition is easily seen in regard to the content, the alignment makes things easy to read, and the proximity makes the site easy on the eyes. My favorite
                parts of the site are the banner slideshow used at the top of the site, as well as the look and feel of the header and footer.
            </p>
            <h4>CRAP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Contrast: The color scheme isn't pure white or pure black, which makes it easy on the eyes, and the blue accent color matches the theme of Microsoft</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Repetition: All the content is easy to find, with the page style using the same heading text, and paragraph text underneath. All the buttons and links are a blue color.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Alignment: The same style of boxes is used throughout the site, and finding what is important is easy due to the sizing of said boxes. </li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Proximity: Nothing is too jumbled up next to each other, and the spacing makes it easy to navigate and read.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, the site has a great use of the CRAP principles, and feels pretty good to navigate and use.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a></h3>
            <p>The Berkshire Hathaway site is my example of a bad site. The usage of CRAP principles is present, but demonstrates a very mediocre use of said principles. The alignment at the bottom is
                frustrating, and the site itself looks like a project I would've created as my third or fourth website. The use of CSS is very minimal, and the site feels like someone copy pasted a few logos,
                added a few lists and links, and called it a day.
            </p>
            <h4>CRAP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Contrast: The contrast in the site is bad. The page is the basic HTML white color, with a dark blue as the font. It's very jarring to look at, and unappealing to use. 
                    When you click the links they turn into this red color that is extremely harsh.
                    (side note: I have a dark reader Chrome extension, and when I first opened the site my brain kind of imploded on itself)</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Repetition: I don't really even know what to say. The links are styled the same? When I click a page it looks kind of the same as the last one? The title is in the same font in the same
                    place?</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Alignment: The alignment is ok. The home page, the footer has horrible alignment compared to the rest of the page. Depending on what link you click, you may find good or bad
                    alignment, it's a dice roll. Every page seems to have a different kind of alignment. The links on the home page are aligned. The links on the rest of the pages are aligned. 
                    That's about it. The padding on some pages drives me crazy.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing">Proximity: I will say, the spacing on most of the pages looks fine. If I needed info from this page, I could probably find it.Except for the "Message from Warren E. Buffet." 
                    The spacing on that page doesn't even really look formatted, it's like someone made a paragraph element and copy pasted the text.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In my opinion, the site is extremely simple to navigate, but has an extremely underwhelming appearance.</p>
