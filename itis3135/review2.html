            <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong> I couldn't even find the site on his page, I had to pull it from GitHub. The pages except main don't have content,
            so I'm just going off of the home page. It looks really good honestly, the font looks nice, the alignment feels good, the colors contrast really well! My only issue is the
         header and footers being the same color, but that's just personal preference. Headers being links kind of throws me off too, but it matches the theme though.</p>

                        <li>If this is a “branded page” it should be the brand/company</li>

                <li>Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent

                <li>Page has specific requirements for this assignment (make a checklist from that assignment and make
                    sure you've covered everything there). If there is a conflict between what you see here and in the
                    instructions, ask on the class forums about it. <span class="reviewfail">X</span> [No content for 4/5 pages, but everything else passes]</li>
