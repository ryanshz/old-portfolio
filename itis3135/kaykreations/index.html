            <h2>Welcome to Kay Kreations!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Kaycee and I enjoy painting, writing and reading. I am Puerto Rican, and fluent in Spanish and English.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;">Kaycee enjoys spending her free time creating art and developing her other creative talents. She has a large collection of
                books at home, and spends a lot of time focusing on the wellbeing of herself and others.
            </p>
            <h2>About this Site</h2>
            <p>You'll find information on Kaycee, as well as her other creative talents. The about page will give a little bit of info on Kaycee,
                and give a small look into her daily life. The gallery page has her public art pieces. The contact and FAQ pages both give a bit
                more info on her and where to get a hold of her if you need to do so.

            <h2>A Quote from Kaycee</h2>
            <figure>
                <blockquote>Multi-sensory perception is also the ability to see meaning in everyday experiences... you have non-physical guides and teachers.
                    You access them through your intuition. You hear them 'so to speak,' through your insights, inspirations, and clarity. Non-physical 
                    teachers cannot control you. You must always decide for yourself how you will use your energy, what you will create. They will assist
                    you to see your choices and the consequences of each. They will guide you to the full scope and depth of your power. How you use
                    your power is up to you.</blockquote>
