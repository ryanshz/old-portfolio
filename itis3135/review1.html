            <p><strong>Initial Thoughts:</strong> Overall, the site looks pretty good. The color scheme between elements isn't too bad, and the font
                is easy to read. The header and footer look solid.
                Some things I noticed off the rip are that the header text contrast is a bit off compared to the background color,
                and no images are on the site. The padding for some
                of the text, especially on the about page, isn't really there, and it takes away from the site. The site would look much better if things like that
                were fixed.
