            <ul>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I lived in Raleigh, NC for most of my life, then moved down here whenever college started. In my spare time, 
                    I'm either at the gym lifting or playing games.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I've worked at Harris Teeter for around four years. I did Customer Service there for two, then switched to 
                    Overnight Stocking afterward, and I've been doing that since. I also interned at Juki Automation Systems for a couple months, while 
                    I was an engineering major.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I started out in Mechanical Engineering, did that for two years, then switched to Computer Science around 
                    a year and a half ago. I'm around a year and a half away from graduating at this point.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> My first exposure to it was in middle school, I wasn't the biggest fan of coding in general back 
                    then. Eventually, after coming to college, I had a moment where I needed to figure out what I wanted to do, and I figured that since I'm on 
                    a computer for a lot of the day already, I might as well just pick up Computer Science, and I've enjoyed it ever since.</li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Usually Linux (Debian) or Mac, I use Windows for personal stuff.</li>
                <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>ITIS 3135 - Web Application Design and Development:</strong> I took this just to have a better understanding of how the internet 
                            works, we use it all day and knowing how to make pages and understand them at a fundamental level sounds cool.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>ITIS 3310 - Software Architecture and Design:</strong> I didn't really know what this course was- but it does seem like something 
                            that will help me whenever I end up working on large-scale projects.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>ITSC 3146 - Intro to Operating Systems and Networking:</strong> I still don't really know what this class was about, all we've 
                            done is install Linux on a virtual machine. Maybe I'll figure out how an OS works or something.</li>
                        <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering:</strong> This is kind of what I want to go into as a career when I graduate, so I had an 
                            interest in this. It seems like it'll help me the most in my professional career.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li class="bullet-spacing"><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I stayed up for around 40 hours at one point because I lost track of time, and then 
                    slept on the floor with a couch cushion as a pillow.</li>
